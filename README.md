# Welcome to PocketBase Experiment!
This experiment initiated in April 9, 2023

## Introduction to PocketBase
`PocketBase` is similar to `Firebase` (a Google service) and `Supabase` (an open-source Firebase alternative), which handles the backend function like file upload, saving data to a database, etc.<br/>

You can download `PocketBase` using the link below:<br/>
<b>•</b> https://pocketbase.io/docs

## How to Run PocketBase?
Once you've downloaded `PocketBase` and it was now in `Downloads`, do the following:<br/>
<b>1.</b> Extract the ZIP file which you downloaded.<br/>
<b>2.</b> Rename it into `PocketBase` or however you like but keep it short.<br/>
<b>3.</b> Go to that directory, ex.: `Downloads/PocketBase`.<br/>
<b>4.</b> Now enter this command:
```
./pocketbase serve
```
If the command above didn't work for you, try this:
```
pocketbase serve
```
<b><em>Note:</em></b> The `pocketbase` you see in the command is not the folder name, it was the keyword for the command.<br/><br/>
<b>5.</b> After running the previous command you will see something like this:
```javascript
2023/04/09 22:11:46 Server started at http://127.0.0.1:8090
 ➜ REST API: http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/
 ➜ Admin UI: http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/
```

## Explaining the Links
Based on the official documentation, the meaning of the links are the following:<br/>
<b>•</b> `http://127.0.0.1:8090` - if pb_public directory exists, serves the static content from it (html, css, images, etc.)<br/>
<b>•</b> `http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/` - Admin dashboard UI<br/>
<b>•</b> `http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/` - REST API<br/>
